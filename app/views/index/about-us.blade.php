                    Josh and I have three beautiful children all under age 6 and have been married for eight years.  Josh and Jodie share a passion for children and understand the importance of what a positive daily environment can do for a child.  They are in the business of molding young lives that will someday change this world.
                    <br /><br />
                    Josh and Jodie started attending Life church about 2 years ago when they moved to Grand Haven.  Life church is just that...LIFE breathing, and refreshing every time we are there.  So we saw a need in the community and decided Life church would be the best place for molding Young Lives.
